# IC-SHM2022-project3

The repository contains the code and documentation for our team's entry in the 3rd International Competition for Structural Health Monitoring(IC-SHM 2022) project 3. Our solution is designed to solve the following 2 tasks:

- Data-driven modeling
- Damage identification

The general descriptions of these 2 tasks and how we solve them are illustrated as follows.

## Getting Started

To get started with our solution, you can follow these steps:

- Clone this repository to your local machine
- Install any dependencies using pip
- Set the workspace to be the folder IC-SHM2022-project3

## Task 1: Data-driven Modeling

## Task 2: Damage Identification

The main goal of the task is to implement damage identification of three specified units in a three-span continuous bridge (other units stay undamaged) through the use of random vibration data from five channels. There are six cases in the testing datasets, and the developed algorithm results in a $6\times3$ matrix.
